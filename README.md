# Ook Syntax Theme #

This is a syntax theme originally designed for my [website](https://dustinwilson.com). I decided to port it to Atom. It is a Base16-style syntax theme that uses colors based off of my website's design. The colors are chosen based upon their WCAG contrast ratio. All colors are within a certain contrast ratio, so no color overpowers another.
